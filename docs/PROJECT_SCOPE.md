```

### Data Architecture

#### Panel Entity System

- **Independent Entities**: Each panel is a separate database record with UUID
- **Sub-Content Storage**: JSON fields for perspective grids, drawings, text, images
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Collections → Layouts → Panels → Content
- **Efficient Queries**: Optimized indexes for common access patterns

#### Content Plugin System

```typescript
interface ContentPlugin {
  type: string;
  name: string;
  render(content: PanelContent, context: RenderContext): void;
  edit(content: PanelContent, tool: Tool): void;
  serialize(content: PanelContent): any;
  deserialize(data: any): PanelContent;
  getTools(): Tool[];
}
```

#### AI Provider Abstraction

```typescript
interface AIProvider {
  name: string;
  generateScript(layout: LayoutData, direction: CreativeDirection): Promise<ComicScript>;
  validateApiKey(key: string): Promise<boolean>;
  getModels(): Promise<Model[]>;
  estimateTokens(content: string): number;
}
```

### Performance Architecture

#### Responsive UI / Authoritative Backend Pattern

- **Frontend (Real-time Interaction Loop):** The SolidJS frontend is responsible for all high-frequency, real-time user interactions (e.g., dragging, resizing, drawing). It maintains a temporary, local UI state to provide a fluid, 60fps experience without waiting for the backend. This local state is considered non-authoritative.
- **Backend (Authoritative Update Loop):** The Rust backend acts as the single source of truth. The frontend communicates the final, settled state of a user action (e.g., on mouse-up after a drag) to the backend via a Tauri command. The backend then validates this data, performs the necessary business logic, and persists the authoritative state to the database. This ensures data integrity and robustness while decoupling the UI's perceived performance from backend processing time.

#### Rendering Optimization

- **Layered Rendering**: Static (guidelines) and dynamic (panels) layers
- **Viewport Culling**: Only render visible panels and content
- **Dirty Region Tracking**: Incremental updates for changed areas
- **GPU Acceleration**: WebGL for complex operations and effects

#### Memory Management

- **Lazy Loading**: Load panel content on-demand
- **Resource Pooling**: Reuse canvas contexts and rendering resources
- **Efficient Serialization**: Minimal JSON payload for database storage
- **Garbage Collection**: Proper cleanup of unused resources

#### Database Performance

- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse database connections
- **Query Optimization**: Prepared statements and efficient indexes
- **Batch Operations**: Group multiple operations for efficiency
- **Background Persistence**: Non-blocking save operations

### Extensibility Design

#### Plugin Architecture

- **Dynamic Loading**: Load plugins at runtime
- **Sandboxed Execution**: Safe plugin execution environment
- **API Versioning**: Backward compatibility for plugin updates
- **Event System**: Plugin communication via events

#### Content Type System

- **Polymorphic Content**: Unified interface for all content types
- **Custom Renderers**: Plugin-provided rendering logic
- **Tool Integration**: Custom tools for content manipulation
- **Serialization**: Extensible serialization format

### Security & Privacy

#### Data Protection

- **Local-Only Storage**: No cloud synchronization or telemetry
- **Encrypted Credentials**: Secure API key storage
- **File Permissions**: Standard user-level file access
- **Input Validation**: Prevent injection attacks and malformed data

#### API Security

- **Key Management**: Secure storage and rotation of API keys
- **Request Validation**: Validate all external API requests
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure without exposing sensitive data
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect provider limits and prevent abuse

## Development Workflow & Release Strategy

### Branching Strategy

#### Branch Structure

## Coding Conventions & Architecture Standards

### Component Architecture

#### Directory Structure

**Standard Component Organization**

```
components/
├── FeatureName/
│   ├── FeatureName.tsx         # Main component implementation
│   ├── index.ts                # Clean export interface
│   ├── SubComponent1/
│   │   ├── SubComponent1.tsx   # Focused subcomponent
│   │   └── index.ts            # Subcomponent export
│   └── utils/
│       ├── helpers.ts          # Component-specific utilities
│       └── types.ts            # Component-specific types
```

**Principles**

- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
- **Directory Encapsulation**: Related components grouped in feature directories
- **Clean Imports**: Use index files to abstract internal structure
- **Utility Separation**: Extract non-UI logic into utility functions

#### Component Decomposition

**Extract Over Embed**

```typescript
// ❌ Avoid: Large monolithic components
const MonolithicComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* 200+ lines of JSX */}
    </div>
  );
};

// ✅ Preferred: Decomposed components
const MainComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <ComponentHeader />
      <ComponentContent />
      <ComponentFooter />
    </div>
  );
};
```

**Component Hierarchy Guidelines**

- **Composition Over Inheritance**: Use component composition patterns
- **Props Drilling Prevention**: Extract subcomponents to reduce prop passing
- **Render Function Extraction**: Convert inline render functions to components
- **Logical Grouping**: Group related UI elements into focused components

### Documentation Standards

#### Component Documentation

**TSDoc Format**

```typescript
/**
 * ComponentName Component
 * 
 * Brief description of component purpose and functionality.
 * Include key behaviors, responsibilities, and usage context.
 * 
 * @module ComponentName
 */
```

**Interface Documentation**

```typescript
/**
 * Props interface for ComponentName component
 * Describes the expected properties and their purposes
 */
interface ComponentProps {
  // Individual properties do not need comments
  // Interface-level comment provides sufficient context
  isVisible: boolean;
  onAction: (id: string) => void;
  data: ComplexDataType;
}
```

#### Code Documentation

**Inline Comments**

- **Complex Logic**: Explain non-obvious business logic
- **State Transitions**: Document state changes and side effects
- **API Interactions**: Describe external service integrations
- **Performance Considerations**: Note optimization decisions

**Avoid Over-Documentation**

- No DEBUG flags or verbose logging utilities
- Focus on clarity through naming over extensive commenting
- Document intent, not implementation details

### HTML & Accessibility Standards

#### Element Identification

**Required Attributes**

```jsx
<div 
  id="component-name-element-purpose"
  data-testid="component-name-element-purpose"
  class="styling-classes"
>
  <button 
    id="component-name-submit-button"
    data-testid="component-name-submit-button"
    onClick={handleSubmit}
  >
    Submit
  </button>
</div>
```

**Naming Conventions**

- **IDs**: `component-name-element-purpose` (kebab-case)
- **Test IDs**: Match ID format for consistency
- **Descriptive**: Include component context and element purpose
- **Unique**: Ensure uniqueness within component scope

#### Semantic HTML

```jsx
// ✅ Use semantic elements
<article id="layout-preview-article">
  <header id="layout-preview-header">
    <h2 id="layout-preview-title">Layout Preview</h2>
  </header>
  <section id="layout-preview-content">
    <nav id="layout-preview-navigation">
      {/* Navigation content */}
    </nav>
    <main id="layout-preview-main">
      {/* Main content */}
    </main>
  </section>
</article>
```

### Export Patterns

#### Component Exports

**Index File Pattern**

```typescript
// components/ComponentName/index.ts
export { ComponentName } from './ComponentName';
export type { ComponentProps } from './ComponentName';
```

**Multi-Component Exports**

```typescript
// components/FeatureName/index.ts
export { MainComponent } from './MainComponent';
export { SubComponent1 } from './SubComponent1';
export { SubComponent2 } from './SubComponent2';
export type { FeatureProps } from './types';
```

#### Import Conventions

```typescript
// ✅ Import from directories
import { ComponentName } from 'components/ComponentName';
import { FeatureComponent } from 'components/FeatureName';

// ❌ Avoid direct file imports
import { ComponentName } from 'components/ComponentName/ComponentName';
```

### State Management

#### Component State

**Local State First**

```typescript
// ✅ Use local state for component-specific data
const Component = () => {
  const [isVisible, setIsVisible] = createSignal(false);
  const [formData, setFormData] = createSignal(initialData);
  
  return (/* JSX */);
};
```

**Custom Hooks for Logic**

```typescript
// ✅ Extract complex state logic
const useComponentLogic = (initialData: Data) => {
  const [state, setState] = createSignal(initialData);
  
  const handleAction = (action: Action) => {
    // Complex state logic
    setState(prevState => /* updated state */);
  };
  
  return { state, handleAction };
};
```

#### Global State

**Stores for Shared Data**

```typescript
// stores/featureStore.ts
interface FeatureState {
  items: Item[];
  selectedId: string | null;
  isLoading: boolean;
}

const [featureStore, setFeatureStore] = createStore<FeatureState>({
  items: [],
  selectedId: null,
  isLoading: false,
});

export { featureStore, setFeatureStore };
```

### Type Safety

#### Interface Design

**Focused Interfaces**

```typescript
// ✅ Single-purpose interfaces
interface PanelData {
  id: string;
  dimensions: Dimensions;
  content: PanelContent;
}

interface PanelActions {
  onSelect: (id: string) => void;
  onResize: (id: string, dimensions: Dimensions) => void;
  onDelete: (id: string) => void;
}
```

**Type Composition**

```typescript
// ✅ Compose types for complex props
type PanelProps = PanelData & PanelActions & {
  isSelected: boolean;
  className?: string;
};
```

### Error Handling

#### Component Error Boundaries

```typescript
// ✅ Wrap feature components in error boundaries
<ErrorBoundary fallback={<FeatureErrorFallback />}>
  <FeatureComponent />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

#### Graceful Degradation

```typescript
// ✅ Handle missing data gracefully
const Component = (props: Props) => {
  return (
    <Switch>
      <Match when={props.data}>
        <ContentView data={props.data} />
      </Match>
      <Match when={!props.data}>
        <EmptyState />
      </Match>
    </Switch>
  );
};
```

### Performance Considerations

#### Memoization Strategy

```typescript
// ✅ Memoize expensive calculations
const ExpensiveComponent = (props: Props) => {
  const processedData = createMemo(() => {
    return expensiveProcessing(props.data);
  });
  
  return <DataView data={processedData()} />;
};
```

#### Component Optimization

```typescript
// ✅ Prevent unnecessary re-renders with lazy evaluation
const OptimizedComponent = (props: Props) => {
  return (
    <Show when={props.data}>
      <PresentationalComponent data={props.data} />
    </Show>
  );
};
```

### Testing Strategy

#### Component Testing

**Test Structure**

```typescript
// ComponentName.test.tsx
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  describe('rendering', () => {
    it('renders with required props', () => {
      // Test basic rendering
    });
  });
  
  describe('interactions', () => {
    it('handles user actions correctly', () => {
      // Test user interactions
    });
  });
  
  describe('state management', () => {
    it('updates state on actions', () => {
      // Test state changes
    });
  });
});
```

#### Testing Utilities

```typescript
// tests/utils/renderWithProviders.tsx
export const renderWithProviders = (ui: () => JSX.Element) => {
  return render(() => (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <StoreProvider>
        {ui()}
      </StoreProvider>
    </ThemeProvider>
  ));
};
```

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

#### Monolithic Components

```typescript
// ❌ Avoid: Single large component file
const MegaComponent = () => {
  // 500+ lines of component logic
  return (
    <div>
      {/* 300+ lines of JSX */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### Prop Drilling

```typescript
// ❌ Avoid: Deep prop passing
<Parent>
  <Child1 prop={value}>
    <Child2 prop={value}>
      <Child3 prop={value} />
    </Child2>
  </Child1>
</Parent>
```

#### Inline Styles

```typescript
// ❌ Avoid: Inline styles for complex styling
<div style={{ "background-color": "red", padding: "20px" }}>
  Content
</div>

// ✅ Use: CSS classes or styled components
<div class="error-container">
  Content
</div>
```

### Code Organization Principles

#### Feature-Based Structure

- **Colocation**: Keep related files together
- **Boundary Definition**: Clear feature boundaries
- **Dependency Direction**: Features depend on shared, not each other
- **Scalability**: Structure supports growth without major refactoring

#### Separation of Concerns

- **UI Components**: Focus on presentation
- **Business Logic**: Extract to custom hooks or services
- **Data Layer**: Separate data access and state management
- **Utilities**: Pure functions for common operations

### Backend Architecture (Tauri Rust)

#### Layered Architecture

**Service Layer Separation**

```rust
// src/services/layout_service.rs
use crate::database::LayoutRepository;
use crate::models::Layout;
use tauri::Result;

pub struct LayoutService {
    repository: LayoutRepository,
}

impl LayoutService {
    pub async fn create_layout(&self, params: CreateLayoutParams) -> Result<u32> {
        // Business logic here
        self.repository.create(params).await
    }
    
    pub async fn get_layout_by_id(&self, id: u32) -> Result<Option<Layout>> {
        self.repository.find_by_id(id).await
    }
}
```

**Repository Pattern**

```rust
// src/database/layout_repository.rs
use rusqlite::{Connection, Result};
use crate::models::Layout;

pub struct LayoutRepository {
    connection: Connection,
}

impl LayoutRepository {
    pub fn new(connection: Connection) -> Self {
        Self { connection }
    }
    
    pub async fn create(&self, params: CreateLayoutParams) -> Result<u32> {
        // Database operations here
    }
    
    pub async fn find_by_id(&self, id: u32) -> Result<Option<Layout>> {
        // Query implementation
    }
}
```

#### Database Management

**Connection Management**

```rust
// src/database/mod.rs
use rusqlite::{Connection, Result};
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};

pub struct DatabaseManager {
    connection: Arc<Mutex<Connection>>,
}

impl DatabaseManager {
    pub fn new(db_path: &str) -> Result<Self> {
        let connection = Connection::open(db_path)?;
        Ok(Self {
            connection: Arc::new(Mutex::new(connection)),
        })
    }
    
    pub fn initialize_schema(&self) -> Result<()> {
        let schema = include_str!("schema.sql");
        self.connection.lock().unwrap().execute_batch(schema)?;
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

**Migration System**

```rust
// src/database/migrations.rs
use rusqlite::{Connection, Result};

pub struct MigrationRunner {
    connection: Connection,
}

impl MigrationRunner {
    pub fn run_migrations(&self) -> Result<()> {
        let migrations = self.get_pending_migrations()?;
        
        for migration in migrations {
            self.run_migration(migration)?;
        }
        
        Ok(())
    }
    
    fn run_migration(&self, migration: Migration) -> Result<()> {
        let tx = self.connection.transaction()?;
        
        match tx.execute_batch(&migration.sql) {
            Ok(_) => {
                tx.commit()?;
                println!("Migration {} completed", migration.name);
            }
            Err(e) => {
                tx.rollback()?;
                return Err(e);
            }
        }
        
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

#### Error Handling

**Custom Error Types**

```rust
// src/errors.rs
use thiserror::Error;

#[derive(Error, Debug)]
pub enum AppError {
    #[error("Database error: {0}")]
    Database(#[from] rusqlite::Error),
    
    #[error("Validation error: {0}")]
    Validation(String),
    
    #[error("Not found: {0}")]
    NotFound(String),
    
    #[error("File system error: {0}")]
    FileSystem(#[from] std::io::Error),
}

pub type Result<T> = std::result::Result<T, AppError>;
```

**Service Error Handling**

```rust
// src/services/layout_service.rs
use crate::errors::{AppError, Result};

impl LayoutService {
    pub async fn update_layout(&self, id: u32, params: UpdateLayoutParams) -> Result<bool> {
        // Validate input
        if params.name.is_empty() {
            return Err(AppError::Validation("Name cannot be empty".to_string()));
        }
        
        // Check if layout exists
        let layout = self.repository.find_by_id(id).await?
            .ok_or_else(|| AppError::NotFound(format!("Layout with id {} not found", id)))?;
        
        // Business logic validation
        if layout.page_type == "front_cover" && params.name != "Front Cover" {
            return Err(AppError::Validation("Cannot change front cover name".to_string()));
        }
        
        self.repository.update(id, params).await
    }
}
```

#### Configuration Management

**Environment Configuration**

```rust
// src/config.rs
use serde::Deserialize;
use std::env;

#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]
pub struct Config {
    pub database_path: String,
    pub thumbnail_storage_path: String,
    pub anthropic_api_key: Option<String>,
}

impl Config {
    pub fn from_env() -> Result<Self, env::VarError> {
        Ok(Self {
            database_path: env::var("DATABASE_PATH")
                .unwrap_or_else(|_| "./data/comic_panelist.db".to_string()),
            thumbnail_storage_path: env::var("THUMBNAIL_STORAGE_PATH")
                .unwrap_or_else(|_| "./data/thumbnails".to_string()),
            anthropic_api_key: env::var("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY").ok(),
        })
    }
    
    pub fn ensure_directories(&self) -> std::io::Result<()> {
        std::fs::create_dir_all(&self.thumbnail_storage_path)?;
        
        // Ensure database directory exists
        if let Some(parent) = std::path::Path::new(&self.database_path).parent() {
            std::fs::create_dir_all(parent)?;
        }
        
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

#### Transaction Management

**Transaction Wrapper**

```rust
// src/database/transaction.rs
use rusqlite::{Connection, Transaction, Result};

pub struct TransactionManager<'a> {
    transaction: Transaction<'a>,
}

impl<'a> TransactionManager<'a> {
    pub fn new(connection: &'a Connection) -> Result<Self> {
        Ok(Self {
            transaction: connection.transaction()?,
        })
    }
    
    pub fn execute<F, T>(&mut self, operation: F) -> Result<T>
    where
        F: FnOnce(&Transaction) -> Result<T>,
    {
        let result = operation(&self.transaction)?;
        self.transaction.commit()?;
        Ok(result)
    }
    
    pub fn rollback(self) -> Result<()> {
        self.transaction.rollback()
    }
}
```

**Service Transaction Usage**

```rust
// src/services/layout_service.rs
impl LayoutService {
    pub async fn create_layout_with_thumbnail(
        &self, 
        params: CreateLayoutParams, 
        thumbnail_data: Option<Vec<u8>>
    ) -> Result<u32> {
        let mut tx = TransactionManager::new(&self.connection)?;
        
        tx.execute(|tx| {
            // Create layout
            let layout_id = self.repository.create_with_transaction(tx, params)?;
            
            // Save thumbnail if provided
            if let Some(data) = thumbnail_data {
                let thumbnail_path = self.save_thumbnail(layout_id, data)?;
                self.repository.update_thumbnail_path(tx, layout_id, thumbnail_path)?;
            }
            
            // Reset display order
            self.repository.reset_display_order(tx, params.collection_id)?;
            
            Ok(layout_id)
        })
    }
}
```

#### File System Operations

**File Management Service**

```rust
// src/services/file_service.rs
use std::path::{Path, PathBuf};
use std::fs;
use crate::errors::Result;

pub struct FileService {
    storage_path: PathBuf,
}

impl FileService {
    pub fn new(storage_path: impl AsRef<Path>) -> Self {
        Self {
            storage_path: storage_path.as_ref().to_path_buf(),
        }
    }
    
    pub fn save_thumbnail(&self, layout_id: u32, data: Vec<u8>) -> Result<String> {
        let filename = format!("layout_{}_thumbnail.png", layout_id);
        let file_path = self.storage_path.join(&filename);
        
        // Ensure directory exists
        if let Some(parent) = file_path.parent() {
            fs::create_dir_all(parent)?;
        }
        
        fs::write(&file_path, data)?;
        
        Ok(filename)
    }
    
    pub fn delete_thumbnail(&self, filename: &str) -> Result<()> {
        let file_path = self.storage_path.join(filename);
        
        if file_path.exists() {
            fs::remove_file(file_path)?;
        }
        
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

#### Tauri Command Integration

**Command Handlers**

```rust
// src/commands/layout_commands.rs
use tauri::State;
use crate::services::LayoutService;
use crate::models::{Layout, CreateLayoutParams};
use crate::errors::Result;

#[tauri::command]
pub async fn create_layout(
    service: State<'_, LayoutService>,
    params: CreateLayoutParams,
) -> Result<u32> {
    service.create_layout(params).await
}

#[tauri::command]
pub async fn get_layout_by_id(
    service: State<'_, LayoutService>,
    id: u32,
) -> Result<Option<Layout>> {
    service.get_layout_by_id(id).await
}

#[tauri::command]
pub async fn update_layout(
    service: State<'_, LayoutService>,
    id: u32,
    params: UpdateLayoutParams,
) -> Result<bool> {
    service.update_layout(id, params).await
}
```

**Application State Management**

```rust
// src/main.rs
use tauri::Manager;
use crate::config::Config;
use crate::database::DatabaseManager;
use crate::services::LayoutService;

fn main() {
    tauri::Builder::default()
        .setup(|app| {
            let config = Config::from_env()?;
            config.ensure_directories()?;
            
            let db_manager = DatabaseManager::new(&config.database_path)?;
            db_manager.initialize_schema()?;
            
            let layout_service = LayoutService::new(db_manager);
            
            app.manage(layout_service);
            app.manage(config);
            
            Ok(())
        })
        .invoke_handler(tauri::generate_handler![
            create_layout,
            get_layout_by_id,
            update_layout,
        ])
        .run(tauri::generate_context!())
        .expect("error while running tauri application");
}
```

#### Testing Strategy

**Unit Testing**

```rust
// src/services/layout_service.rs
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use crate::database::test_utils::create_test_db;
    
    #[tokio::test]
    async fn test_create_layout() {
        let db = create_test_db().await;
        let service = LayoutService::new(db);
        
        let params = CreateLayoutParams {
            collection_id: 1,
            name: "Test Layout".to_string(),
            panel_data: serde_json::json!({"panels": []}),
        };
        
        let result = service.create_layout(params).await;
        assert!(result.is_ok());
        
        let layout_id = result.unwrap();
        assert!(layout_id > 0);
    }
}
```
